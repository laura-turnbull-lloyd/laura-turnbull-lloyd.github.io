My research falls broadly into the following themes: climate change and extreme events, ecohydrology and ecogeomorphology, land degradation, critical transitions and ecosystem state change, biogeochemical fluxes, and biophysical resilience of drylands. My research within these themes is focused on understanding interactions and feedbacks between hydrology, geomorphology and ecology that drive surface processes in terrestrial systems. 
Most of my research to date has been in drylands, where low rainfall and high land-use pressures make ecogeomorphic feedbacks particularly pronounced, making them an ideal “model system” to study these feedbacks.
My research relies heavily on multiple approaches: experimental work, long-term data synthesis, remote sensing, process-based modelling and geospatial analysis.
